This challenge was very fun to work on! I had the opportunity to experiment with various tools and techniques, and Iâ€™m proud of how everything came together.

Hereâ€™s what I played with:

* React for building the app
* @preact/signals-react to manage simple reactive state
* A small splash screen just for a bit of polish
* Different layouts for the auth pages and the main content
* A handful of custom hooks (debounced search, keyboard shortcuts, focus first input, fade-in animations, etc.)
* Redux to manage bookmarks, using localforage for persistence and reselect for selectors
* Supabase Auth for handling login/signup
* React Router with guards to protect routes unless the user is logged in
* Zod + React Hook Form for form validation
* A basic data fetching hook
* Integration with TheMovieDB API, including showing YouTube trailers
